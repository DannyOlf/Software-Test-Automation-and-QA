How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By adhering to industry best practices and keeping the requirements in mind, I can ensure that my code is both functional and secure. Furthermore, I create tests that check for each requirement and check the coverage of the code. Thus, ensuring that the entire code base behaves as expected and has as few bugs/defects as possible.
 
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I do my best to keep things as simple as possible. I also try to stay focused on the problem, rather than the solution. This helps me to avoid most of my own person biases when trying to figure out how to solve a problem. That is to say, I try not to get attached to a solution, but rather keep in mind what the problem I am trying to solve needs. 

How do I approach designing software?

Occamâ€™s Razor states that the simplest solution is often the right one. In my experience, the same concept can be applied to design. The simplest design that meets all of the requirements is often the best way to go; it makes the code easier to maintain and scale later on as requirements change.
